## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ‚úÖ Required Files
- [ ] `index.html` - Main application
- [ ] `firebase-messaging-sw.js` - Service worker
- [ ] `manifest.json` - PWA manifest
- [ ] `assets/` folder - All images and sounds

### ‚úÖ Configuration Check
- [ ] Firebase API key is correct (not placeholder)
- [ ] VAPID key is properly configured
- [ ] All file paths are relative (no absolute paths)
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled (required for push notifications)

### ‚úÖ Testing
- [ ] App loads without errors
- [ ] Notification toggle works
- [ ] Tasks can be created and completed
- [ ] PWA installation prompt appears
- [ ] Service worker registers successfully

## üîß Post-Deployment Setup

### 1. Test Push Notifications
```javascript
// Open browser console on your deployed site
// Enable notifications in Settings first
window.sendTestNotification(); // If function exists
```

### 2. Verify PWA Installation
- Mobile: Look for "Add to Home Screen" prompt
- Desktop: Check for install icon in address bar
- Test offline functionality

### 3. Monitor Console Logs
Check for any errors in browser developer tools:
- Firebase initialization
- Service worker registration
- Notification permissions

## üåê Domain Configuration

### Custom Domain (Optional)
Most hosting platforms allow custom domains:
1. Purchase domain from registrar
2. Update DNS settings to point to hosting platform
3. Configure SSL certificate (usually automatic)
4. Update any hardcoded URLs if necessary

### HTTPS Requirement
Push notifications require HTTPS. Most modern hosting platforms provide this automatically:
- GitHub Pages: Automatic HTTPS
- Netlify: Automatic HTTPS
- Vercel: Automatic HTTPS
- Firebase: Automatic HTTPS

## üì± Mobile App Store (Optional)

### PWA to App Store
You can submit PWAs to app stores:
- **Google Play Store**: Use TWA (Trusted Web Activity)
- **Microsoft Store**: Direct PWA submission
- **Apple App Store**: Use PWABuilder or similar tools

### Tools for App Store Submission
- [PWABuilder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/) - Microsoft tool for PWA packaging
- [Bubblewrap](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/bubblewrap) - Google's TWA tool
- [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) - Ionic's native app wrapper

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

**Service Worker Not Loading**
- Ensure `firebase-messaging-sw.js` is in root directory
- Check HTTPS is enabled
- Verify no 404 errors in network tab

**Push Notifications Not Working**
- Confirm HTTPS deployment
- Check Firebase configuration
- Verify VAPID key is correct
- Test notification permissions

**PWA Not Installing**
- Ensure `manifest.json` is properly linked
- Check all required manifest fields
- Verify service worker is registered
- Test on HTTPS

**Assets Not Loading**
- Check all file paths are relative
- Ensure `assets/` folder is uploaded
- Verify image file extensions match code

### Performance Optimization

**Image Optimization**
```bash
# Compress images before deployment
# Use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim
```

**Caching Strategy**
The service worker handles caching automatically, but you can:
- Enable gzip compression on server
- Set appropriate cache headers
- Use CDN for static assets

## üìä Analytics (Optional)

Add Google Analytics or similar:
```html
<!-- Add to <head> section of index.html -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_MEASUREMENT_ID"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID');
</script>
```

## üéØ Success Metrics

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] App loads in under 3 seconds
- [ ] PWA installation works on mobile
- [ ] Push notifications deliver reliably
- [ ] All features work as expected
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Responsive design works on all devices
